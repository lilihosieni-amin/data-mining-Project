# data-mining-Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a healthcare dataset aimed at predicting stroke occurrences. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization, we seek to identify patterns and correlations among patient attributes, such as age, gender, BMI, and lifestyle factors, that may contribute to stroke risk. This analysis serves as a foundational step, providing insights into the data structure and relationships that may guide future predictive modeling efforts to improve stroke risk assessment.
